# Locale Routing Fix

## Issue Summary

The create room and join room functionality was not working because the routing was missing locale prefixes. When users created or joined rooms, they were being redirected to `/room/{code}` instead of `/{locale}/room/{code}`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. CreateRoom Component

**File:** `components/room/CreateRoom.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `useParams` import to get current locale
- Extract locale from params: `const locale = params.locale as string`
- Updated navigation to include locale: `router.push(\`/\${locale}/room/\${data.roomCode}\`)`

**Before:**

```typescript
router.push(`/room/${data.roomCode}`);
```

**After:**

```typescript
router.push(`/${locale}/room/${data.roomCode}`);
```

### 2. JoinRoom Component

**File:** `components/room/JoinRoom.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `useParams` import to get current locale
- Extract locale from params: `const locale = params.locale as string`
- Updated navigation to include locale: `router.push(\`/\${locale}/room/\${roomCode.trim().toUpperCase()}\`)`

**Before:**

```typescript
router.push(`/room/${roomCode.trim().toUpperCase()}`);
```

**After:**

```typescript
router.push(`/${locale}/room/${roomCode.trim().toUpperCase()}`);
```

### 3. Room Page Structure

**Issue:** Room pages were in `app/(game)/room/[code]` but needed to be in `app/[locale]/room/[code]` for locale routing to work.

**Solution:**

- Created `app/[locale]/room/[code]/` directory structure
- Copied room page to the new location

**Command:**

```bash
mkdir -p app/[locale]/room/[code]
cp app/\(game\)/room/[code]/page.tsx app/[locale]/room/[code]/page.tsx
```

## Default Language Configuration

### Already Configured âœ…

The default language is already set to Thai in the configuration:

**File:** `lib/i18n/config.ts`

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_LOCALE: LocaleCode = 'th'; // Thai as default per spec
```

### Middleware Behavior

The middleware automatically:

1. Detects if URL has a locale prefix
2. If not, redirects to default locale (Thai)
3. Checks cookie `NEXT_LOCALE` first
4. Falls back to `Accept-Language` header
5. Finally uses `DEFAULT_LOCALE` ('th')

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Default Language

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. âœ… Should redirect to `http://localhost:3001/th`
3. âœ… Page should display in Thai

### Test 2: Create Room

1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/th`
2. Enter a player name in the "à¸Šà¸·à¹ˆà¸­à¸œà¸¹à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¹ˆà¸™" field under "à¸ªà¸£à¹‰à¸²à¸‡à¸«à¹‰à¸­à¸‡"
3. Click "à¸ªà¸£à¹‰à¸²à¸‡à¸«à¹‰à¸­à¸‡" button
4. âœ… Should navigate to `http://localhost:3001/th/room/{ROOM_CODE}`
5. âœ… Room lobby should display in Thai

### Test 3: Join Room

1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/th`
2. Enter a player name in the "à¸Šà¸·à¹ˆà¸­à¸œà¸¹à¹‰à¹€à¸¥à¹ˆà¸™" field under "à¹€à¸‚à¹‰à¸²à¸£à¹ˆà¸§à¸¡à¸«à¹‰à¸­à¸‡"
3. Enter a room code in the "à¸£à¸«à¸±à¸ªà¸«à¹‰à¸­à¸‡" field
4. Click "à¹€à¸‚à¹‰à¸²à¸£à¹ˆà¸§à¸¡à¸«à¹‰à¸­à¸‡" button
5. âœ… Should navigate to `http://localhost:3001/th/room/{ROOM_CODE}`
6. âœ… Room lobby should display in Thai

### Test 4: Language Switching

1. Create or join a room in Thai
2. Switch language using the dropdown (top right)
3. âœ… URL should update to `http://localhost:3001/{NEW_LOCALE}/room/{ROOM_CODE}`
4. âœ… All UI should update to the new language

### Test 5: Direct URL Access

1. Try accessing `http://localhost:3001/room/ABC123` (without locale)
2. âœ… Should redirect to `http://localhost:3001/th/room/ABC123`

### Test 6: English Language

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/en`
2. âœ… Page should display in English
3. Create/join room
4. âœ… Should navigate to `http://localhost:3001/en/room/{ROOM_CODE}`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Default locale set to 'th' in config
- [x] Middleware redirects to Thai by default
- [x] CreateRoom component uses locale in navigation
- [x] JoinRoom component uses locale in navigation
- [x] Room pages exist in `app/[locale]/room/[code]/`
- [ ] Manual testing: Create room in Thai
- [ ] Manual testing: Join room in Thai
- [ ] Manual testing: Language switching works
- [ ] Manual testing: Room functionality works in all 7 languages

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Room Page Location

The room page exists in two locations:

- `app/(game)/room/[code]/page.tsx` (old location, may cause conflicts)
- `app/[locale]/room/[code]/page.tsx` (new location, correct)

**Recommendation:** Remove the old location to avoid confusion:

```bash
rm -rf app/\(game\)/room
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test create room functionality
2. âœ… Test join room functionality
3. âœ… Verify locale routing works correctly
4. âœ… Test all 7 languages
5. âœ… Remove old room folder if everything works

## Summary

The locale routing is now fixed! All room creation and joining flows will properly maintain the user's selected language throughout the entire application. The default language is Thai as specified in the requirements.

**Key Points:**

- âœ… Default language: Thai (th)
- âœ… CreateRoom: Includes locale in navigation
- âœ… JoinRoom: Includes locale in navigation
- âœ… Room pages: In correct locale folder structure
- âœ… Middleware: Handles locale detection and redirection

Ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
