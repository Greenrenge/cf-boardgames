# UX Improvements: Language & Theme Toggle Consistency ✅

## Date: October 30, 2025

## Issue Identified

The room page had inconsistent UX compared to the homepage:

1. **Missing Language Switcher** - Room page only had theme toggle, no way to change language
2. **Inconsistent Layout** - Theme toggle was positioned differently on room vs homepage
3. **Poor UX** - Users entering a room couldn't change their language preference

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Added Language Switcher to Room Page

Added the `LanguageSwitcher` component to the room page so users can change languages while in a game room.

### ✅ Consistent Top-Right Layout

Both homepage and room page now have the same layout:

- **Fixed position** in top-right corner
- **Flex container** with gap-3
- **Order**: Language Switcher → Theme Toggle
- **Styling**: Consistent spacing and positioning

## Changes Made

### 1. Room Page (`app/[locale]/room/[code]/page.tsx`)

**Added Import:**

```tsx
import { LanguageSwitcher } from '@/components/i18n/LanguageSwitcher';
```

**Before (Connecting State):**

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center ...">
  <ThemeToggle />
  <div className="text-center">// connecting spinner</div>
</div>
```

**After (Connecting State):**

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center ...">
  {/* Top right controls */}
  <div className="fixed top-4 right-4 z-50 flex items-center gap-3">
    <LanguageSwitcher />
    <ThemeToggle />
  </div>
  <div className="text-center">// connecting spinner</div>
</div>
```

**Before (Main State):**

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen ... py-8 px-4">
  <ThemeToggle />
  <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6">// back button and player info</div>
</div>
```

**After (Main State):**

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen ... py-8 px-4">
  {/* Top right controls */}
  <div className="fixed top-4 right-4 z-50 flex items-center gap-3">
    <LanguageSwitcher />
    <ThemeToggle />
  </div>

  <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6">// back button and player info</div>
</div>
```

### 2. Homepage (`app/[locale]/page.tsx`)

Already had the correct layout (no changes needed):

```tsx
<div className="fixed top-4 right-4 z-50 flex items-center gap-3">
  <LanguageSwitcher />
  <ThemeToggle />
</div>
```
