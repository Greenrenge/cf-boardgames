## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Roles still showing in Thai when English selected

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check language switcher is set correctly
4. Open browser console for errors

### Issue: Console shows "Failed to load role translations"

**Check:**
1. File exists: `locales/en/roles.json`
2. File has content (not empty)
3. No JSON syntax errors
4. Network tab shows file loaded

### Issue: Some roles display slug keys (e.g., "security-guard")

**This means:**
- Translation missing for that role
- Fallback to slug display
- Check the specific role in `locales/*/roles.json`
