## How to Use This Checklist

**Remember**: This checklist tests the QUALITY of your requirements writing, not whether the implementation works.

Each item asks:
- ✅ **CORRECT**: "Are requirements clearly specified for X?" (testing the spec)
- ❌ **WRONG**: "Does the system do X correctly?" (testing implementation)

**Workflow**:
1. **Review systematically**: Go through each checklist item in order
2. **Check adequate items**: Mark ✅ if requirement is well-specified, clear, and complete
3. **Document gaps**: For unchecked items, note what needs to be added/clarified
4. **Update specifications**: Revise spec.md, plan.md, or data-model.md to address gaps
5. **Resolve conflicts**: Make decisions on conflicting requirements and update consistently
6. **Track progress**: Aim for >90% completion before implementation starts
7. **Re-validate**: After updates, re-run checklist to verify all gaps addressed

**Goal**: Have comprehensive, clear, consistent, testable requirements that developers can implement with confidence.
