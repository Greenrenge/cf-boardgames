# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Language Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

### Details:

**Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on what users need (multi-language support) and why (accessibility, global reach), without prescribing technical solutions. It's written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "100% of location names translated", "switch languages within 2 seconds"). No clarifications are needed as all requirements are sufficiently detailed. Edge cases comprehensively cover scenarios like missing translations, RTL languages, browser language detection, and multi-player language independence.

**Feature Readiness**: All five user stories have clear acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format. The prioritization (P1 for language selection and location translation, P2 for roles and UI, P3 for enhanced UX) creates independently testable slices. Success criteria are technology-agnostic and verifiable through the playground.

## Notes

- The specification includes comprehensive translation requirements: 84 locations × 7 languages = 588 location names, and 588 roles × 7 languages = 4,116 role translations, plus complete UI translation
- RTL support for Arabic is clearly specified as a requirement
- The spec appropriately uses "localization" (cultural adaptation) rather than just "translation" (literal word conversion)
- Language-neutral IDs for game state ensure players can use different languages in the same room
- Fallback strategy (English → Thai) ensures graceful degradation
