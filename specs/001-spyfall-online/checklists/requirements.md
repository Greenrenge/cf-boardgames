# Specification Quality Checklist: Spyfall Online - Thai Edition

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: PASS

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

**Specification Strengths**:

- Comprehensive user stories with clear priorities (P1-P5) enabling incremental delivery
- Detailed edge case handling for disconnections, reconnections, and error scenarios
- Well-defined real-time communication requirements with specific latency targets
- Clear multi-game architecture support for future expansion
- Thorough playground validation plan with step-by-step testing instructions
- Measurable success criteria covering performance, usability, and user satisfaction

**Assumptions Made**:

- Room codes are 6-character alphanumeric (standard practice for shareable codes)
- Disconnection timeout is 2 minutes (balances user experience with resource management)
- Empty room cleanup is 5 minutes (allows brief disconnections without losing rooms)
- Timer range is 5-15 minutes (typical for social deduction games)
- Thai localization uses Thai language for all UI elements
- 100 Thai locations divided into Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty levels
- Player name persistence uses browser localStorage (simple, no account required)
- Duplicate names handled by appending numbers (low-friction UX)
- Voting tie results in no elimination (fair gameplay mechanic)

**Ready for Next Phase**: âœ… Proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholder review needed
