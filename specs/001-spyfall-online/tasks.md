# Tasks: Spyfall Online - Thai Edition

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-spyfall-online/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Per constitution (Playground Over Tests), no test tasks included. Validation via working playground.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and demonstration of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Web application structure (monorepo):

- **Frontend**: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` at repository root
- **Backend**: `workers/src/`
- **Shared**: `lib/types.ts` for TypeScript types
- **Data**: `data/locations.json` for Thai locations

---

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) after Phase 2
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs room/player infrastructure)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 (extends voting phase)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on User Story 2 (extends round system)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational - Architectural, can be done alongside others

### Within Each User Story

- Playground setup first (document test approach)
- Backend models and handlers before frontend components
- WebSocket handlers before frontend message handling
- UI components before page integration
- State management last (after all pieces exist)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Backend and Frontend work can happen in parallel within a story (different files)
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Backend tasks (different developer or different time):
Task T028: "Implement GameRoom Durable Object class"
Task T029: "Implement room creation handler"
Task T030: "Implement get room info handler"

# Frontend tasks (can happen simultaneously with backend):
Task T036: "Create home page"
Task T037: "Create CreateRoom component"
Task T038: "Create JoinRoom component"
Task T042: "Create PlayerList component"
Task T043: "Create Lobby component"

# Then integrate:
Task T044: "Create game room page (uses WebSocket + components)"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 playground independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! Room system works)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full game playable!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Spy guess adds depth)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Multi-round competition)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Future-proof architecture)
7. Polish ‚Üí Final QA ‚Üí Production launch

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:

1. **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T026-T050)
2. **Developer B**: User Story 5 (T115-T125) - Architecture work, doesn't block others
3. Once US1 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (T051-T091)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 scaffolding (T092-T093, T098-T099)
4. Once US2 complete:
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (T104-T114)
   - **Developer C**: Finish User Story 3 (T100-T103)

- [P] tasks use different files - safe to parallelize
- [Story] labels enable tracking implementation by user story
- Each user story is independently testable via playground
- Backend and frontend tasks separated for parallel development
- No test tasks per constitution (Playground Over Tests principle)
- Formatters run in polish phase (Prettier for consistency)
- Thai localization added in polish phase
- Deployment concerns addressed in final polish tasks
