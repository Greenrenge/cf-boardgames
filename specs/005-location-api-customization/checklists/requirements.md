- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

**Validation Complete**: All checklist items passed on October 30, 2025

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Q1: Removed locations handling - Keep locations from local storage even if removed from API (Option B)
2. Q2: Export/import functionality - In scope, provide export/import for configurations (Option B)

**Ready for next phase**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
