# Tasks: Location API Customization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-location-api-customization/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Playgrounds**: Tasks include playground/demo creation to validate each user story works. Tests are optional (per constitution).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and demonstration of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T003 Create feature branch 005-location-api-customization (if not already created)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - API endpoint working, types defined, cache layer implemented. User story implementation can now begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - API as Single Source of Truth (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Fetch all location data including translations from API, eliminating separate translation files. Display skeleton UI during loading.

## Phase 4: User Story 5 - Local Storage and API Merge Strategy (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement intelligent merge logic where localStorage overrides API data for matching IDs, new API locations are added, and custom locations are preserved.

**Independent Test**: Manually set location data in localStorage, fetch API data, verify merge behavior: matching IDs use localStorage values, new API locations are added, removed locations remain.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, merge logic is working - localStorage overrides API, new locations are added, custom locations preserved.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 2 - Location and Role Customization (Priority: P1)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Host Location Selection Persistence (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Save host's location selections to localStorage automatically when game starts, and restore them when creating a new room.

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Export and Import Configurations (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow users to export location selections to JSON file and import previously exported configurations for backup and sharing.

**Independent Test**: Customize selections, export to JSON file, clear localStorage or use different browser, import file, verify selections are restored correctly.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 5 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (US1 helps but not required)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational and US5 completion (needs merge logic)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US2 completion (needs customization UI)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US3 completion (same persistence mechanism)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US2 completion (needs working customization)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundation (Phase 2) - BLOCKS ALL STORIES

US1 (Phase 3) ----‚Üí US5 (Phase 4) ----‚Üí US2 (Phase 5)

                                       Polish (Phase 9)
```

**Critical Path**: Foundation ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí Polish  
**Parallel Opportunities**: US1 can run in parallel with US5 (both depend only on Foundation)

### Within Each User Story

- Playground creation FIRST (create scaffold, then implement until it works)
- Type definitions before implementations
- Models before services
- Services before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete and validated via playground before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- All type definition tasks (T004-T009) can run in parallel
- Component stubs (T104-T105) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**:

- T030, T031, T032 (component updates) can run in parallel
- T036-T042 (file deletions) can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US5)**:

- T048, T051 (utility file creation) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US2)**:

- T064, T065, T066 (component creation) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (US6)**:

- T104, T105 (button components) can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (Polish)**:

- Most polish tasks are parallelizable (marked with [P])

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Create playground scaffold first:
Task: "Create playground directory specs/005-location-api-customization/playground/story2/"
Task: "Create README.md in playground/story2/ with customization UI demo instructions"

# Launch all component creations in parallel:
Task: "Create LocationList component in components/location/LocationList.tsx"
Task: "Create LocationItem component in components/location/LocationItem.tsx with expand/collapse"
Task: "Create RoleSelector component in components/location/RoleSelector.tsx with checkboxes"

# Then connect them together after components exist:
Task: "Modify Lobby component in components/room/Lobby.tsx to integrate LocationList"
Task: "Add validation to prevent game start when no locations are selected"

# Finally build demo:
Task: "Create demo showing location/role selection UI with live preview"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 5, 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (API integration)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 5 (Merge logic)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 2 (Customization UI)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core functionality independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready (users can now customize locations!)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation + US1 + US5 + US2** ‚Üí Basic customization works (MVP!)
2. **Add US3** ‚Üí Host persistence (convenience feature)
3. **Add US4** ‚Üí Non-host saving (collaboration feature)
4. **Add US6** ‚Üí Export/import (power user feature)
5. **Polish** ‚Üí Final refinements

Each addition adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundation is complete):

- **Developer A**: US1 (API integration) ‚Üí US3 (Host persistence)
- **Developer B**: US5 (Merge logic) ‚Üí US2 (Customization UI) ‚Üí US6 (Export/import)
- **Developer C**: Polish tasks in parallel

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Playgrounds**: Create scaffold FIRST, then implement until it works
- **Constitution compliance**: Playground validation over tests, declarative patterns, readable code
- **File paths**: All paths are relative to repository root
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Testing**: Each playground validates the user story independently
- **Performance**: React.memo for list items, no virtualization needed for 80-120 items
- **Caching**: 24-hour cache for API responses, indefinite persistence for user selections
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime validation of API responses and import files
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
- **Avoid**: Speculative features, unnecessary abstractions, clever code over clear code
- **Prefer**: Simple solutions, declarative patterns, readable names, consistent style

---

## Total Task Count: 140 tasks

### Breakdown by Phase:

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 3 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 21 tasks (BLOCKS all user stories)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - API Integration)**: 21 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US5 - Merge Logic)**: 16 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US2 - Customization UI)**: 20 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US3 - Host Persistence)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US4 - Non-Host Saving)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Export/Import)**: 20 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: 20 tasks

### MVP Scope Recommendation:

**Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 only** (81 tasks) - This delivers core value: API integration, merge logic, and customization UI. Users can customize locations and roles, with selections persisting automatically. Phases 6-8 add convenience features that can be delivered incrementally.
