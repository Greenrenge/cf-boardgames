# Specification Quality Checklist: Location Images & Player Scaling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on user-facing features (image display, player capacity, spy configuration) without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - All 36 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all design decisions were made with reasonable defaults)
   - Success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
   - Edge cases cover failure scenarios, boundary conditions, and performance concerns

3. **Feature Readiness**: 
   - 5 user stories with clear priorities and independent test scenarios
   - Each functional requirement can be verified through the playground validation steps
   - Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "images load within 2 seconds" not "Redis cache response time")

## Design Decisions & Assumptions

The following reasonable defaults were applied to avoid unnecessary clarifications:

1. **Image Aspect Ratio**: Fixed at 3:2 as explicitly specified by user
2. **Player Capacity Range**: 4-20 players (user specified 20 max, 4 is current minimum from existing spec)
3. **Spy Count Options**: 1-3 spies as explicitly specified by user
4. **Minimum Player-to-Spy Ratio**: 3:1 ratio ensures balanced gameplay (standard for social deduction games)
5. **Image Organization**: Alphabetical or by difficulty (both are reasonable and can be decided during implementation)
6. **Performance Targets**: Based on modern web standards (60fps, <2s load time, etc.)
7. **Multi-Spy Coordination**: Spies don't know each other's identities (maintains game balance)
8. **Location Guess with Multiple Spies**: Only one guess total (prevents unfair advantage)

## Notes

- The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All user stories are independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Performance and UX requirements are specific enough to validate but flexible enough for implementation choices
- Edge cases cover the most likely failure scenarios without over-specifying
